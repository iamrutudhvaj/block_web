# Website Blocker Chrome Extension

## ðŸš€ About the Project

**Website Blocker** was born out of a simple yet powerful need: **focus in a world full of distractions**.

Imagine this: you're working on an important project or trying to study for an exam. You tell yourself, "Just five minutes on social media, and then I'll focus." But before you know it, hours have slipped away, and the work remains untouched. Sounds familiar?

This project was created to help people like usâ€”people who value their time but sometimes need a gentle nudge to stay on track. By blocking distracting websites, **Website Blocker** empowers you to take control of your digital habits, so you can focus on what truly matters.
